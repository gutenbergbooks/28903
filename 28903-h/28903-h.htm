<span class="i2">The beauty of our faith in God.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And wither as the tempests blew,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Our faith, which had not known the test,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I must get out to the woods again, to the whispering tree, and the birds a-wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away from the haunts of pale-faced men, to the spaces wide where strength is king;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must get out where the skies are blue and the air is clean and the rest is sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out where there's never a task to do or a goal to reach or a foe to meet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I must get out on the trails once more that wind through shadowy haunts and cool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away from the presence of wall and door, and see myself in a crystal pool;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must get out with the silent things, where neither laughter nor hate is heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where malice never the humblest stings and no one is hurt by a spoken word.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, I've heard the call of the tall white pine, and heard the call of the running brook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm tired of the tasks which each day are mine, I'm weary of reading a printed book;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I want to get out of the din and strife, the clang and clamor of turning wheel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And walk for a day where life is life, and the joys are true and the pictures real.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And take some deed accomplished for my pay.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I cannot offer much in silver fees,<br /></span>
